1. What is the address of DllMain?
- 0x1000D02E
2. Use the Imports window to browse to gethostbyname. Where is the import
located?
- 0x100163CC (.idata section) 
3. How many functions call gethostbyname?
- 5 functions and 9 difference calls
4. Focusing on the call to gethostbyname located at 0x10001757, can you fig-
ure out which DNS request will be made?
- An DNS request to pics.practicalanalysis.com will be made
5. How many local variables has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at
0x10001656?
- 23 local vars
6. How many parameters has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at
0x10001656?
- 1 (LPVOID lpThreadParameter)
7. Use the Strings window to locate the string \cmd.exe /c in the disassembly.
Where is it located?
- 0x10095B34 (xdoors_d section)
8. What is happening in the area of code that references \cmd.exe /c?
- Create a remote session for the attacker/
9. In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global
variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set
dword_1008E5C4? (Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4â€™s cross-references.)
- dword_1008E5C4 is set if The operating system is Windows NT or later.
10. A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of com-
parisons use memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string compar-
ison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0)?
- It creates a new registry key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/CurrentVersion/Worktime
11.  What does the export PSLIST do?
- It gets a list of processes or a particular process across the network
12. Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79.
Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on
the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?
- GetSystemDefaultLangID
- target_os_language
13. How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many
at a depth of 2?
- 4
14. At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one
parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking
backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code
executes?
- 30000 miliseconds (30 secs)
15. At 0x10001701 is a call to socket. What are the three parameters?
- int protocol, int type, int af
16. Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants func-
tionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful?
What are the parameters after you apply changes?
- IPPROTO_TCP (protocol), SOCK_STREAM (type), AF_INET (af)
17. Search for usage of the in instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is
used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use
in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes
the in instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?
- Yes since it is located in the .text section
- There are 3 functions which execute the in instruction namely InstallRT, InstallSA, InstallSB
