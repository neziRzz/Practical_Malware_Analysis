1. What is the difference between the calls made from the main method in
Labs 6-3 and 6-4?
- A call to sub_401248 
2. What new code construct has been added to main?
  - For loop
3. What is the difference between this lab’s parse HTML function and
those of the previous labs?
- The function now take an integer as a parameter and we can also see that at the call to this function in the main method, it push the index variable to be the function argument
- The argument then is used to index the User Agent format `Internet Explorer/pma%d` (“%d” is a format specifier in C programming which act as a placeholder for an integer argument)
4. How long will this program run? (Assume that it is connected to the
Internet.)
- If the malware doesnt reach the sleep case in the switch case subroutine then it would be around 1 day else will be around 2.7 days 
5. Are there any new network-based indicators for this malware?
- `Internet Explorer/pma%d`
6. What is the purpose of this malware?
- Same as lab06-03 but the malware use a for loop to loop through 1440 different user agents in `Internet Explorer/pma%d` format (%d range from 0-1439)
