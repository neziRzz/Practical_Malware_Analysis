1. How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves per-
sistence) when the computer is restarted?
  - It creates a service name `Malservice` by using `StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA`
2. Why does this program use a mutex?
  - To ensure that there is only one version of it is curentlly running
3. What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?
  - `Malservice`
  - `HGL345`
4. What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware?
  - `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`
  - `Internet Explorer 8.0`
5. What is the purpose of this program?

  - First it achieve persistence by registering itself as a service name `Malservice` which means every time windows boots up the malware will be always running since services always run at startup

  - Then it make a call to `OpenMutexA` to open a mutex name `HGL345` if the call fails the malware terminates else jump to `loc_401064` which then make a call to `CreateMutexA`(This is to ensure that only one copy of this malware is currently running since if the first call to `OpenMutexA` is sucessful which indicates that the mutex for this malware is already in uses)

  - Create a service name `Malservice`
  - We can see that with `dwStartType` value being 0x2 and `dwServiceType` value being 0x10
we can guarantee that this malware will run at system start up and its type is `Service that runs in its own process.` (According to MSDN page)
  - Create a timer until 0:00 January 1st 2100, then call `WaitForSingleObject` to wait for the timer's signal, if the function returns 0 then the malware continues to execute, else the malware terminates

  - Create 20 threads with the start address mentioned at the image above ( decrement edi until it reaches 0), it attempts to download the `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` site for 20 times and if there are many machines affected with this malware, the website mentioned above can be out of service
  - To conclude, this is a ddos botnet malware 
6. When will this program finish executing?
  - The program runs indefinitelyl
